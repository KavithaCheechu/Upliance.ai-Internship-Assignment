# Upliance.ai-Internship-Assignment
This project as a part of Upliance.ai Data Analyst Internship assignment is created to analyze datasets related to user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends.

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analysing datasets related to user behaviour, cooking preferences, and order trends. The goal is to derive actionable insights and business recommendations by performing data cleaning, merging, analysis, and visualization.

**Objective**
	• Understand user behaviour: Analyse demographic factors influencing user activities.
	• Identify trends: Study cooking session patterns and their relationship to user orders.
	• Discover popular dishes: Identify dishes frequently ordered by users.
	• Provide business recommendations: Offer insights to improve user engagement and operational strategies.

**Datasets**
The project utilizes the following csv dataset with below Sheets:
	1. UserDetails: Contains demographic and data about users.
	2. CookingSessions: Includes records of user cooking session preferences and activities.
	3. OrderDetails: Provides order transaction details, including dishes and timestamps.

**Key Tasks**
	1. Data Cleaning & pre-processing:
		○ Handle missing or inconsistent data.
		○ Standardize column names and data formats for seamless merging.
	2. Data Merging:
		○ Integrate data from the three datasets to enable comprehensive analysis.
	3. Analysis:
		○ Study relationships between cooking sessions and order trends.
		○ Identify demographic factors influencing user behaviour.
		○ Highlight the most popular dishes.
	4. Visualizations:
		○ Create charts and graphs to showcase key findings.
		○ Use tools like Python visualization libraries for effective data representation.
	5. Reporting:
		○ Summarize findings in a report with actionable business recommendations.

**Project Structure**
The repository is organized as follows:
|--Excel data/
    |-- UserDetails.csv
    |-- CookingSessions.csv
    |-- OrderDetails.csv
|-- notebooks/
    |-- Upliance_Assignment.ipynb
|-- outputs/
    |-- visualizations/
    |-- reports/
|-- README.md

**Tools & Technologies**
	• Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization (libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.).
	• Excel: For quick data exploration and validation.
	• GitHub: For version control and project management.

**Deliverables**
	1. Cleaned Datasets: Saved in the data/ folder.
	2. Visualizations: Key insights represented visually in the outputs/visualizations/ folder.
	3. Report: A comprehensive report with findings and business recommendations in the outputs/reports/ folder.

**Future Improvements**
	• Enhance analysis with advanced machine learning models.
	• Explore additional datasets for a more comprehensive understanding of user behaviour.
	• Automate the entire data pipeline for scalability.
