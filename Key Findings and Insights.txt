### Key Findings and Insights  

After performing a detailed analysis of the provided datasets, here are my summarized insights:

#### Data Overview
- The analysis was based on three interconnected datasets: **UserDetails**, **CookingSessions**, and **OrderDetails**, each having clear Primary and Foreign Key relationships:
  - `User ID` connects **UserDetails** and **CookingSessions**.
  - `Session ID` connects **CookingSessions** and **OrderDetails**.
  - `User ID` connects **UserDetails** and **OrderDetails**.
- Minimal data cleaning was required, as the datasets had very few null values. Only two rows under `Rating` were null, attributed to canceled orders, and were excluded as they didnâ€™t impact the study.
